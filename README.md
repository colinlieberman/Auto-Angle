Auto Angle by Colin Lieberman
============================

About
----

This plugin tweaks the rendering option "Vertical offset for networked scenery" based on your altitude. In a future version it will be configurable, right now it's just 5 degress down when you're above 800m (~2600ft) agl, and resets to no adjustment below that.

This is to give a nice view of the scenery below you, but automatically resetting the view to make landing reasonable.

How to Build
------------

I know the community is really into [QT Creator](http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/). Not me. I don't like some framework making my Makefile for me. I think the way for us to all play nicely together is to check in individual & platform specific Makefiles, eg Makefile-OSX10.5-i686.

You can symlink the checkedin Makefil that works for you to Makefile. That way you could stick a QT .pro in here, and move the Makefile it makes to a reasonable name, check that in, and add the symlink. Then there's a .gitignore so you don't accidentlly check in your own Makefile (unless its name is changed per above).
